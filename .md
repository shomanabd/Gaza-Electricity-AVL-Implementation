# Gaza Electricity Data Management System

## Overview
This application implements an electricity data management system for the Gaza Strip using an AVL tree data structure. It efficiently stores, retrieves, and analyzes electricity supply data with a hierarchical date-based structure (year → month → day). The system features a comprehensive set of data management tools and statistical analysis capabilities.

## Features

### Data Management
- **Load Data**: Import electricity records from CSV files
- **Insert Records**: Add new entries with date and electricity metrics
- **Update Records**: Modify existing electricity records
- **Delete Records**: Remove specific entries by date
- **Search Records**: Quickly locate records by day, month, and year
- **Print by Level**: Visualize the AVL tree structure by level for any month/year
- **Print Height**: View the height of the AVL tree structure

### Statistics
The system provides comprehensive statistics across different time periods:
- **Daily Statistics**: View metrics for a specific day across all months/years
- **Monthly Statistics**: Analyze data for a specific month across all years
- **Yearly Statistics**: Examine trends for an entire year
- **Total Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics including:
  - Minimum values
  - Maximum values
  - Sum totals
  - Averages

These statistics are available for all metrics:
- Israeli Lines (MWs)
- Gaza Power Plant (MWs)
- Egyptian Lines (MWs)
- Total Daily Supply (MWs)
- Overall Demand (MWs)
- Power Cuts (hours/day)
- Temperature (°C)

### Data Persistence
- Save updates back to the original data file
- Export data to new CSV files

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
The system uses a three-level AVL tree hierarchy:
1. **Year Tree**: Root-level AVL tree sorted by year
2. **Month Tree**: For each year node, an AVL subtree sorted by month
3. **Day Tree**: For each month node, an AVL subtree sorted by day
4. **Data Storage**: Each day node points to an ElectricityRecord object

This balanced tree structure ensures O(log n) time complexity for all major operations:
- Insertions
- Deletions
- Searches
- Updates

### Core Classes
- **AVL**: Main AVL tree implementation with balancing, rotations, and operations
- **AVLTreeNode**: Node class with height tracking and generic object pointer
- **ElectricityRecord**: Data class for electricity metrics

## Data Format
Each electricity record contains:
- Date (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD)
- Israeli Lines (MWs)
- Gaza Power Plant (MWs)
- Egyptian Lines (MWs)
- Total Daily Supply (MWs)
- Overall Demand (MWs)
- Power Cuts (hours/day)
- Temperature (°C)

## Background
The Gaza Strip has faced ongoing electricity shortages for years. This project uses real-world data from the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO) as reported to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The data provides insights into electricity supply, demand, and shortages in the region.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Java JDK installed (version 8 or higher recommended)
2. Compile all `.java` files in the project
3. Run the application
4. Use the File menu to load electricity data from a CSV file
5. Navigate through the interface to manage data and generate statistics

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Record
```java
// Sample code to add a new electricity record
int day = 15;
int month = 5;
int year = 2022;
ElectricityRecord record = new ElectricityRecord(
    "2022-05-15",       // Date
    120.5f,             // Israeli Lines (MWs)
    40.0f,              // Gaza Power Plant (MWs)
    15.5f,              // Egyptian Lines (MWs)
    176.0f,             // Total Daily Supply (MWs)
    420.0f,             // Overall Demand (MWs)
    12.0f,              // Power Cuts (hours/day)
    22.5f               // Temperature (°C)
);
avlTree.add(day, month, year, record);
```

### Retrieving Statistics
```java
// Get yearly statistics for 2022
String yearlyStats = avlTree.yearStatistic(2022);

// Get total statistics across all data
double[] totalStats = avlTree.total();
// totalStats[0-6]: Minimum values
// totalStats[7-13]: Maximum values
// totalStats[14-20]: Sum values
// totalStats[21-27]: Average values
```
